# FCIC24_Workshop_AI
FCIC24 - Workshop G02 Artificial Intelligence for Participatory Processes in Heritage Planning

Workshop Leader: Dr. Nan Bai (Delft University of Technology, Wageningen University and Research), Dr. Mahda Foroughi (Delft University of Technology)

This repository contains a Python notebook hosted on Google Colab that you can follow to reproduce many of the results presented during the workshop presentation by Nan and Mahda. You have the chance to bring in your own case-study city and collect your own datasets in ready-to-use formats for further research and heritage investigations. A pipeline from data collection, data processing, feature representation (with pre-trained deep learning models), label classification (with predefined machine learning algorithms), and data visualization will be introduced and followed step-by-step, but in a much easier way. 

You probably need some knowledge of programming to understand what happens in each part. However, it does not matter that much if you do not. Just walk through all the steps and you will at least have some interesting results at hand.

After this workshop, you will be able to:
*   understand how social media data can be used to map urban heritage with the help of AI;
*   apply the introduced computational pipeline in their case study of interest in producing maps;
*   critically analyze and evaluate the meanings, potentials, and limitations of
the methods introduced during the workshop.

Before going on, make sure that you have:
*   made a decision on your own case study area, and collected the geolocation of the area (Latitude $y$, Longitude $x$, and Radius $r$ from the centre); if you do not have one (not recommended), just use the following as default (lat = 41.150505, lon = 8.636225, radius = 0.5), which will collect data from the Faculdade de Arquitectura from the Universidade do Porto;
*   registered an account on Flickr (https://identity.flickr.com/sign-up)
*   applied for an API key from Flickr (https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply) after signing in;
*   had at hand safely and secretly the key and secret of your applied API;
*   set the api_key and api_secret as "Secrets" in the left panel.
